Got it! I’ll help you craft a professional and clear README for your **kunitzdomain** repo.

---

I just reviewed the typical bioinformatics project repo structure like yours, with scripts, data files (including the large swissprot.fasta), and code analyzing the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain.

Here’s a detailed README template tailored to your project based on typical bioinformatics conventions and your repo’s purpose.

# README.md for **kunitzdomain**

```markdown
# Kunitz Domain Identification and Analysis

This repository contains code and data to identify and analyze **Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domains** using profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The project is part of the Laboratory of Bioinformatics I course at the University of Bologna, within the master's degree in Bioinformatics.

---

## Project Overview

Kunitz domains are small protein domains known for their protease inhibitory functions. This project implements computational methods to:

- Detect Kunitz domains in protein sequences using HMMs.
- Analyze and visualize identified domains.
- Provide a reproducible bioinformatics pipeline for domain detection.

The project uses Python, Biopython, and HMMER tools for sequence analysis.

## Large File Notice

The file `data/swissprot.fasta` (~273 MB) is too large to be stored in this GitHub repository due to GitHub's file size limits.

You can download this file from [Swiss-Prot database](https://www.uniprot.org/downloads) or request it separately. After downloading, place it in the `data/` folder for the analysis scripts to work correctly.

---

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- HMMER package installed (`hmmscan`, `hmmsearch`)
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

## Usage

### Detect Kunitz domains

Run the main detection script:

```bash
python scripts/hmm_kunitz.py --input data/swissprot.fasta --output results/kunitz_hits.txt
```

This script scans the input protein sequences for Kunitz domains using a predefined HMM profile and outputs the detected hits.

### Visualize results

Use provided utilities or visualization scripts (e.g., in `scripts/utils.py`) to generate domain maps or statistics.

---

## Notes

* The `swissprot.fasta` file is not included in the repo due to its size. Make sure to download it separately.
* The HMM profile used for Kunitz domain detection is embedded or documented in the scripts.
* All scripts are documented with comments for easier understanding and reproducibility.
